WordPress Term Duplicator allows you to copy or duplicate WordPress categories, tags, or taxonomy terms.

== Description ==

Sometimes you need to duplicate a category or tag (or custom taxonomy term) in WordPress, and up until now there wasn't really an easy way to do this.  This plugin adds a "Duplicate" link in the actions under a term on its respective view. That's it.
